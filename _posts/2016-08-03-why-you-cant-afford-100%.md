Capital is not the limiting resource for your side project. Your limiting resource is time. Elon Musk is famous for saying that if you work 80 hrs a week while your competition works 40hrs a week you will get twice as much done as them in any given amount of time. I’d say thats at least mostly true.

In that case if you are working on something just on the side you may get as little as 1/4 as much done in the same amount of time as someone who is working on the same idea 40+ hrs a week.

So what can you do? Is working on your side project a hopeless cause? Should we just throw in the towel now and get back to life as mindless sheep?

**No!**

An old Italian Economist discovered a hack that can give us a leg up, even with limited time.

It’s called The Pareto Principle.

Vilfredo Pareto is the guy who made the observation that lots of times about 80% of the results come from about 20% of the inputs. He figured this out working in his garden back in the 1800’s where he observed that 80% of the pea pods came from 20% of the plants.

Let’s take a look at how we can apply this to our advantage in the case of our side projects.

For most products, 80% of the functionality comes from 20% of the product’s features. Let’s take Microsoft Word as an example. Most of the benefit of using Word comes from being able to enter text and minimally format that text. Those two things only make up about 20% of the application. The other 80% provide fringe benefits and are mostly ignored by anyone who uses Word.
The big temptation is to try and cram in 100% of the features and polish that you can dream up into the first version so that your product will be the best in the world! The truth is that you can’t afford 100% especially if we’re talking about side projects.

Find the magic 20%. The 20% that will solve 80% of the pain or provide 80% of the enjoyment. Then just build that and ignore the rest for now. You will be able to build a freakin awesome product in less time than your overambitious, overboard competitors and it will be something that people actually want.

**Don’t drink the 100% Koolaid. Build 20% and rule the world!**
