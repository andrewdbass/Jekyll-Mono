I have been seriously geeking out over this concept for the last couple of weeks. And besides helping me build better projects, I have noticed several other surprising benefits of JBTBD thinking.

# 1. Going to the Mall with my wife became enjoyable all of a sudden.
Sephora and I never used to get along before. I would wander around aimlessly, reading something on my phone while my wife would do her thing. Not anymore. When I end up in Sephora or any other store for that matter I constantly ask my self, “What is the customer hiring this thing to do?” I read the signage and try to figure out what is going on in the mind of the customer. It’s a blast. It’s like tracking the human mind.

# 2. Rationalizing big purchases became dangerously easy.
When I want something now, it is really easy to connect it back to a monumental and important aspiration of mine and to show how that thing moves me closer to achieving it. This is a very good thing.

# 3. Every perplexing thing in my past and present involving other Humans started to make sense.
Looking back I start to connect the dots. Why did that one product fail? Why did that person like me? Why do people some people like Donald Trump so much? Basically if a situation involves humans, Jobs to Be Done can help shed some light.

Will I ever be the same as I was before? Probably not. JTBD thinking has irreversible and potent side effects that have yet to be fully documented.

One(actually two) thing is/are for sure. JTBD is a heckuva way to see the world and products that I build now will be significantly better because of it!
