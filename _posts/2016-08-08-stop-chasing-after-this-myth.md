title: Stop chasing after this myth.
---


I’ve got a great idea. How about you pour your heart and soul into a product and then release it into the world and have it judged out the wazoo? Any takers? Didn’t think so.

We are all terrified that our project will not be good enough. If we let our project run its natural course, we would spend forever tweaking little things trying to get it “perfect”

But, guess what, “Perfect” just doesn’t exist. Its a myth. It’s like one those mystic, elusive, white stags that people always chase in stories but never actually find.

So, how do we fight this? How do we fight the urge to spend forever fixing little things and and actually ship our product?

**Set a deadline.**

Figure out the 20%, find out a reasonable timeline for you to get it done and then commit to it! No matter what, you have to ship on that date. This will help you focus on what really matters and it will guarantee that you actually get your project out there.
If you feel like you will need some help actually sticking to your deadline, try this little trick. Get a friend to post embarrassing pictures of you the day after if you don’t launch. How’s that for motivation.

Set a deadline and ship your little baby into the world. Don’t chase the stag.
